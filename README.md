# **COVID19-Analysis-with-SQL**
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing data related to the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries. This dataset provides information about COVID-19 cases such as deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccinations across different locations and continents. We aim to provide insight and answer important questions about the pandemic as well as provide further exploratory and/or predictive analysis.

## Getting Started

### Clone COVID19-Analysis-with-SQL project
>cd destination\
>git clone https://github.com/albertjseo/COVID19-Analysis-with-SQL.git

### Check branch
You will want to be sure that you are in your 'dev' branch before proceeding. *If a 'dev' branch does not exist, you will need to create one.*
> git status (if status reads 'On branch dev' proceed to next)
> \

If status reads On branch 'main' and a 'dev' branch does not exist, you will need to create it before switching.
> git switch -c dev

### Good coding practice
>* remember to create a new virtual environment (/venv)

### Required packages
You will need to use requirements.txt to install the required packages onto your local machine.
>pip install -r requirements.txt
